## File Sorting and Fractal Generation

### Task 1: Recursive File Sorting

The first script automates the process of sorting files from a source directory into subdirectories in a target directory based on their file extensions.
It showcases the use of recursion for directory traversal and the os and shutil modules for file operations.

#### Features:
- Recursively scans a source directory.
- Sorts files into subdirectories within a target directory based on file extensions.
- Creates subdirectories dynamically based on the extensions of the files found.

#### Technologies Used:
- Python
- os module
- shutil module

#### Usage:

`python file_sorter.py <source_directory> [<target_directory>]`

### Task 2: Koch Snowflake Fractal

The second script generates a Koch snowflake fractal, an example of a simple yet beautiful natural fractal pattern.
Users can specify the recursion depth to vary the complexity of the generated snowflake.

#### Features:
- Generates a Koch snowflake fractal.
- Allows user to specify the recursion depth.
- Utilizes the turtle graphics library for drawing.

#### Technologies Used:
- Python
- turtle module

#### Usage:

`python koch_snowflake.py`
